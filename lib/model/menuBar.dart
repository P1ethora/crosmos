His daughter Rosa recounted that her father invented the salad at his Prohibition-era restaurant in Tijuana, Mexico when a Fourth of July rush in 1924 depleted the kitchen\u0027s supplies. (Cardini lived in San Diego but ran the family restaurant in Tijuana to attract American customers seeking to circumvent the restrictions of the Prohibition). Cardini made do with what he had, adding the dramatic flair of the table-side tossing \"by the chef.\" A number of Cardini\u0027s staff have said that they invented the dish.",

The Dictionary of the Russian Academy (1794) indicated the name solyanka as the main variant, and marked the selyanka variant as \"simple\"",
